# Simple Finance
A simple personal finance application.

## Project description
I want a basic overview in one page where I can see my incomes and expenditures, total amounts of each
and total balance either negative or positive. The reason for this project is that other solutions are too
complex and require a lot of work to setup, while all I want is a simple overview of my financial health.
